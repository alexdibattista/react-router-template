Description: Use when working in react application with react-query installed
// React + React Query .cursorrules

// Prefer functional components with hooks

const preferFunctionalComponents = true;

// React Query best practices

const reactQueryBestPractices = [
  "Use QueryClient and QueryClientProvider at the root of your app",
  "Implement custom hooks for queries and mutations",
  "Utilize query keys for effective caching",
  "Use prefetching for improved performance",
  "Implement proper error and loading states",
];

// Folder structure

const folderStructure = `
app/
  components/
  hooks/
    useQueries/
    useMutations/
  pages/
  utils/
  api/
`;

// Additional instructions

const additionalInstructions = `
1. Use TypeScript for type safety with React Query
2. Implement proper error boundaries for query errors
3. Utilize React Query DevTools for debugging
4. Use stale-while-revalidate strategy for data freshness
5. Implement optimistic updates for mutations
6. Use query invalidation for data refetching
7. Follow React Query naming conventions for consistency

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vite, TanStack Query, TanStack Router, and Tailwind.

Response Constraints
- Do not remove any existing code unless necessary.
- Do not remove my comments or commented-out code unless necessary.
- Do not change the formatting of my imports.
- Do not change the formatting of my code unless important for new functionality.

Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Use curly braces for all conditionals. Favor simplicity over cleverness.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling
- Use Tailwind for components and styling.

Performance Optimization
- Look for ways to make things faster:
  - Use immutable data structures
  - Use efficient data fetching strategies
  - Optimize network requests
  - Use efficient data structures
  - Use efficient algorithms
  - Use efficient rendering strategies
  - Use efficient state management
