# Accessibility Guidelines

Accessibility is a core principle of our design system. We strive to ensure all components are usable by everyone, regardless of abilities or disabilities.

## Accessibility Tab

All component stories include an **Accessibility** tab that automatically runs accessibility checks and displays results in three categories:

- **Violations**: Issues that must be fixed to meet accessibility standards
- **Passes**: Successfully implemented accessibility features
- **Incomplete**: Areas that require manual testing or further verification

This tab is powered by the axe-core accessibility testing engine and helps identify common issues during development.

## Core Principles

### Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements must be accessible via keyboard
- Focus states must be visible and distinct
- Tab order should follow a logical flow
- Keyboard shortcuts should not conflict with assistive technologies

### Screen Reader Support

- All images require descriptive alt text
- Form elements must have associated labels
- ARIA attributes should be used appropriately where native semantics are insufficient
- Dynamic content changes should be announced to screen readers

### Color and Contrast

- Text must have a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 against its background (3:1 for large text)
- Color alone should never be used to convey information
- Interactive elements should have distinct focus and hover states
- Test components in both light and dark modes

### Content Structure

- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, etc.)
- Headings should follow a logical hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.)
- Group related form elements with `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) for sequential or related items

## Implementation Guidelines

```jsx
// ❌ Inaccessible example
<div onClick={handleClick}>Click me</div>

// ✅ Accessible example
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```

```jsx
// ❌ Missing label
<input type="text" />

// ✅ With proper labeling
<label htmlFor="username">Username</label>
<input id="username" type="text" />
```

## WCAG Compliance

Our components aim to meet [WCAG 2.1 AA standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/), which include:

- **Perceivable**: Information must be presentable in ways all users can perceive
- **Operable**: User interface and navigation must be operable by everyone
- **Understandable**: Information and operation must be understandable
- **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to work with various assistive technologies

## Testing Requirements

To ensure accessibility:

1. Test with the Accessibility tab in each story
2. Perform keyboard-only navigation testing
3. Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)
4. Verify color contrast using the provided tools
5. Test at various zoom levels (up to 200%)
